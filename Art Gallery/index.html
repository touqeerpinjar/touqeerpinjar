                        <p>Amrita Sher-Gil has been referred as one of the groundbreaking female artists of the early 20th century. She was also a keen reader and a pianist. Sher-Gil's paintings were way ahead of its time and are among the most high-priced amongst the Indian women painters today.  
                          She had lived her childhood in numerous areas of India and Europe, and had been subjected to diverse cultural backgrounds, due to which she had imbibed a deep interpretation of artistic styles and traditions. Some of her famous artworks include “Tribal Women” and “Young girls”
